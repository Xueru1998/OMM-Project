# OMM-Project

add new package in react-frontend:

1. "react-router-dom" for navigation
2. "bootstrap" for pop-up windows (If npm i bootstrap cannot work, then please use "npm i react-bootstrap")
3. "react-share" to give options for sharing memes
4. "react-infinite-scroll-component" for endless scroll
5. "react-scroll-horizontal" for horizontal scroll
6. "react-input-multiline" for input multiline

backend:

1. cors: to allows a server to indicate any origins (domain, scheme, or port) other than its own from which a browser should permit loading resources.
2. multer: handling multipart/form-data, which is primarily used for uploading files.
3. bcryptjs: incorporate a salt to encrypt password.
4. jsonwebtoken: for secure communication.
